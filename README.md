# Easy toggle state

Tiny JavaScript plugin to toggle the state of any HTML element in any context. Only set some HTML attributes, and code the rest with your CSS skills.

## Why?

In many situation in front-end developer's life, he must code scripts for dropdown, burger navigation, tooltip, expandable panel, lightbox, tabs, or else.

In facts, all this componants are based on the same behavior: a trigger element that toggle the state of one or several target elements, and some CSS to make it nice to use, depending on the look and feel of its context.

Here is the solution I propose: one script to toggle a trigger element and its targets, that can adapt to most of contexts, just by adding the rights HTML attributes, and adjust the rest with CSS.

## How to use

### Basic

```html
<foo data-toggle-class="class-to-toggle">
```
A CSS class that will be toggled on click on this trigger element.

###	Advanced

```
data-toggle-target-all="selector"
```
Add this attribute to toggle the class on the trigger element and all selected targets in the whole page.

```
data-toggle-target-parent="selector"
```
Add this attribute to toggle the class on the trigger element and all selected targets in trigger's parent element.

```
data-toggle-target-self="selector"
```
Add this attribute to toggle the class on the trigger element and all the selected targets inside the trigger element.

```
data-toggle-is-active
```
Add this attribute to specify if a trigger element and its targets has to be toggled by default (onLoad). You should add the specified class name on each element.

```
data-toggle-event="event"
```
Add this attribute to specify another event to toggle the class, ``mouseover`` for example. ``click`` as default if not specified.

```
data-toggle-outside
```
Add this attribute to toggle off the class when reproducing the event outside the trigger element.

```
data-toggle-target-only
```
Add this attribute to toggle the class only on the target elements.

```
data-toggle-escape
```
Add this attribute to toggle the class when trigger element was already triggered and escape key is released.

```
data-toggle-trigger-off
```
Add this attribute on an element __inside a target element__ (typically button or link) to enable this element to toggle off.

### More

If ``aria-expanded`` or ``aria-selected`` attribute is set on the trigger element, its value will also be changed.

You can also specify another prefix ``TOGGLE_CLASS_PREFIX`` value to avoid any conflict with other JavaScript feature. This prefix will be set to all attributes like ``data-[prefix]class``.

For single page application, You can call ``window.initEasyToggleState()`` when You need it.
